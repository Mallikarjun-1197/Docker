What if you can package your application with all its dependencies and call it a budle and run it anywhere ( in any machine / host ) ? Docker helps with this. It helps to provide a consistent behaviour 
of our application across environments.

Concept of Virtual machine vs docker : 
  Before jumping into this.. 
      An operating system is made of 2 slabs (well there are many underhood), OS kernel and Application Layer.. OS kernel receives instructions from app layer and orchestrates the hardware of the 
      machine( memory, cpu ). If you run a cal app your code compiles down to a binary and kernal takes it as input to provide memory etc..
  With above in place , virtual machines virtualizes the entire OS meaning it creates a space on your machine which has its own os kernel and app layer.. while docker only virtualizes the app layer,
  and uses the machine host ( kernel ). which is why a VM takes some time to start since it has to start its kernel and also consumes more space since it brings its own OS.
